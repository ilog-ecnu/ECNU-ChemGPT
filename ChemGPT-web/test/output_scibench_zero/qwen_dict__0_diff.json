However, in this case, it's more straightforward to recognize that the denominator represents a system with damping and a natural frequency. The denominator can be rewritten in a form that suggests completing the square or using partial fractions if it doesn't factor easily. \n\nGiven the complexity of directly solving for $Y(s)$, let's focus on finding $k_1$ for which the peak value of $y$ is 2. The peak value of any function corresponds to the maximum value of its absolute value. In the context of the Laplace transform, this means considering the magnitude of the frequency response of the system. For a second-order system, the peak value in the time domain, when expressed in the frequency domain, corresponds to the amplitude of the system's frequency response at a frequency that maximizes the system's response.\n\nThe peak response occurs when the input frequency matches the natural frequency of the system. For a critically damped or underdamped system (which this is, since $\\gamma < 2$), the peak response to a unit impulse (when $k=1$) is determined by the damping ratio $\\zeta$ and the natural frequency $\\omega_n$. However, since we are scaling the impulse with $k$, we need to find the specific $k$ that results in a peak value of 2.\n\nThe peak value of the response to an impulse in a second-order system, when transformed back to the time domain, can be found using the formula for the overshoot in systems with a damping ratio $\\zeta$ and natural frequency $\\omega_n$, which is complex in this case due to the quadratic term not being easily factorable into real roots for $\\gamma=\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nFor simplicity, and given the complexity of directly applying these formulas without the specific form of the solution, we'll approach this problem via the Laplace transform result and the concept of peak response in terms of input scaling.\n\nGiven that the peak value of 2 is desired and corresponds to a unit impulse ($k=1$) for a system with a certain $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_n$, we can infer that scaling $k$ will scale the peak response proportionally. To find $k_1$, we need to set up an equation based on the peak response formula for a second-order system, adjusted for this specific case. However, without the specific method of calculating the peak response for this system from its Laplace transform solution, this problem requires an understanding that the peak response formula for a second-order system involves $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_n$ and their relationship to the input $k$.\n\nFor the sake of this explanation and keeping it within the bounds of finding $k_1$ through reasoning, we can't directly provide the formula for the peak response in terms of $k$ without going through the detailed analysis of the system's frequency response. The peak response $Y_{\\text{peak}}$ for an impulse input in a second-order system is generally given by:\n\n\\[ Y_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} \\]\n\nWhere $A$ is the amplitude of the impulse, and $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio. However, in this case, we're scaling $k$ to achieve a specific peak response of 2. \n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that a direct formula isn't provided for this specific system without detailed analysis, and considering the nature of the question aiming for a conceptual understanding rather than a detailed mathematical derivation, the direct calculation of $k_1$ from the given differential equation and its solution would typically involve solving for the specific values of $\\zeta$, $\\omega_n$, and $A$ under the condition where $Y_{\\text{peak}} = 2$.\n\nHowever, without the explicit steps to solve the differential equation into its time-domain solution and then back into a formula for the peak response that includes $k$, it's challenging to provide a numerical answer for $k_1$. The approach would involve understanding how the peak response of the system changes with $k$, which in a second-order system with damping is typically analyzed through its transfer function or frequency response.\n\nFor the sake of providing an answer aligned with the question's request for a numerical response, let's consider a conceptual simplification based on the understanding that for a unit impulse ($k=1$), the peak response corresponds to the system's natural behavior. If we adjust $k$ to achieve a peak response of 2, we're essentially scaling the impulse to increase the amplitude of the response. The specific value of $k_1$ would require solving the differential equation and analyzing the system's response to find the exact scaling factor that results in a 2-fold increase in the peak response.\n\nGiven the lack of detailed mathematical steps to directly calculate $k_1$ from the differential equation, the answer that aligns with the question's request for a numerical response, based on the conceptual understanding provided, cannot directly be calculated here without additional information or mathematical derivation specific to the system's properties.\n\nTherefore, the answer cannot be provided as a precise numerical value for $k_1$ based on the information given and the complexity of solving the differential equation for its peak response in this context.

The maximum or minimum value of the oscillation occurs when the exponential term equals zero, which is not the case here since the term involves $- \\frac{2}{3}t$.\n\nHowever, to ensure the solution does not cross the $t$-axis, we consider the scenario where the function $y(t)$ transitions from positive to negative without crossing, implying the amplitude of oscillation is zero at some point inside the interval of interest. This interpretation is a bit misleading in context because, for a linear differential equation with a non-constant forcing term and a decaying exponential term, the solution typically oscillates with decreasing amplitude without crossing the $t$-axis, approaching zero asymptotically.\n\nGiven the typical behavior of solutions to such differential equations and the goal to have the solution touch but not cross the $t$-axis, it might imply looking for the condition where the oscillation's peak or trough is at the $t$-axis, which is not directly addressed by the equation's structure and initial condition provided.\n\nA more precise interpretation of the question might be seeking the condition for $y_0$ under which the solution remains positive for all $t$. Since the differential equation describes a system that decays over time due to the exponential term $Ce^{-\\frac{2}{3}t}$, for the solution to never touch the $t$-axis (i.e., remain positive), we should ensure that the initial condition $y_0$ is set such that the solution's growth (due to the $1 - \\frac{1}{2}t$ term) is balanced by the decay rate to prevent the solution from becoming negative.\n\nGiven the context and typical behavior of solutions to such differential equations, the question might be better framed to seek a condition that ensures $y(t)$ remains positive for all $t$, acknowledging that in reality, the oscillation's amplitude will decrease to zero asymptotically under the provided differential equation's conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, without additional clarification or a specific condition for the amplitude or behavior of the solution at specific points, determining an explicit value for $y_0$ based solely on the instruction provided is challenging. However, for a differential equation of this type, the solution's behavior is such that it will not cross the $t$-axis without additional constraints or modifications to the equation or the initial conditions. \n\nGiven the context and the typical behavior of such equations, a direct answer to the question as posed might be that there is no specific value of $y_0$ that satisfies the condition of touching the $t$-axis without crossing, based on the standard behavior of solutions to this type of differential equation. The oscillation's amplitude decreases over time, and without additional constraints, the solution will asymptotically approach the $t$-axis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is therefore \\boxed{no specific value}.", "correct answer": "\u22121.642876@@ ", "qwen answer": "no specific value", "source book": "diff"}, {"correct": true, "qwen solution": "To determine the decay rate \\(r\\) for thorium-234, we can use the given information and the formula for exponential decay, which is described by the differential equation \\(dQ/dt = -rQ\\), where \\(Q\\) is the amount of the substance at time \\(t\\), and \\(r\\) is the decay rate.\n\nFirst, we have to convert the decay process from weeks to days, as we want the decay rate \\(r\\) in \\(\\text{day}^{-1}\\).
