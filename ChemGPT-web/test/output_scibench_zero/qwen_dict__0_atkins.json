The volume of ethanol can be found as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Density}} = \\frac{35 \\text{ g}}{0.789 \\text{ g/cm}^3} = 44.31 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the Ideal Gas Law for Pressure Change:**\n   To find the change in volume, we'll use the ideal gas law, which is $PV = nRT$, where $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. Since the process is isothermal (constant temperature), we have $nRT$ constant. We can then find the ratio of the final volume to the initial volume:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{V_f}{V_i} = \\frac{P_i}{P_f}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the given pressures ($P_i = 1 \\text{ atm}$ and $P_f = 3000 \\text{ atm}$) and solving for the final volume:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{V_f}{44.31 \\text{ cm}^3} = \\frac{1 \\text{ atm}}{3000 \\text{ atm}} \\rightarrow V_f = \\frac{44.31 \\text{ cm}^3}{3000} = 0.01477 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Change in Volume:**\n   The change in volume ($\\Delta V$) can be found by subtracting the final volume from the initial volume:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta V = 44.31 \\text{ cm}^3 - 0.01477 \\text{ cm}^3 = 44.29523 \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Change in Gibbs Energy:**\n   The change in Gibbs energy for an isothermal process can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta G = -nRT\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   However, we need to convert the volume change from $\\text{cm}^3$ to $\\text{m}^3$ because the gas constant $R$ is usually in units that correlate with molar quantities, and thus the volume change should also be in molar units. Recall that $1 \\text{ cm}^3 = 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^3$. Therefore,\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta V = 44.29523 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^3\n   \\]\n\n   Knowing that $n = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{molar mass}}$, we find the number of moles of ethanol.

We're asked to find the height at which the composition changes to 90% nitrogen and 10% oxygen by mass, assuming a constant temperature of \\(25^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\). Since the temperature is constant and assuming no significant changes in volume (though this is a simplification), we can focus on the mass fractions for this calculation.\n\n#### Step 2: Using the Ideal Gas Law to Relate Pressure and Number of Molecules\nThe Ideal Gas Law can also be written as \\(n = \\frac{P}{RT}\\), where \\(n\\) represents the number of moles of a substance. However, since we are interested in the mass fraction of nitrogen and oxygen changing, and not the total volume of the atmosphere, we'll focus more on the mass aspect and less on changing the volume of the atmosphere.\n\n#### Step 3: Calculating the Height for Desired Composition\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding that the number of molecules (\\(n\\)) of nitrogen and oxygen does not change significantly with height in the Earth's atmosphere under normal conditions, given the constant temperature and assuming no significant changes in volume. This implies that the change in composition is a result of the decrease in atmospheric pressure with altitude as we move away from the surface.\n\n#### Step 4: Using the Atmospheric Pressure Decrease with Altitude\nAtmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude, and this relationship can be modeled with the barometric formula:\n\\[P = P_0 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{h}{H}}\\]\nwhere \\(P\\) is the atmospheric pressure at any height \\(h\\), \\(P_0\\) is the pressure at the surface, \\(H\\) is the scale height of the atmosphere, and \\(e\\) is the base of the natural logarithm. The scale height \\(H\\) is approximately 8.4 km for the Earth.\n\n#### Step 5: Calculating the Pressure Ratio to Find the New Height\nWe want to find the height \\(h\\) where the composition changes. However, to directly calculate this height, we need to understand the relationship between the mass fractions given the constancy of temperature and volume (in a simplified sense). The direct calculation of height based on composition change is more complex without specific pressure or volume data. Instead, let's focus on the pressure aspect given the unit of the answer is \\(\\mathrm{atm}\\).\n\n#### Step 6: Calculate the Pressure at the New Composition\nThe question seems to focus on the pressure aspect rather than the height for composition change. If we were to calculate the pressure at the height where the composition changes to 90% nitrogen and 10% oxygen, we would need the initial pressure (\\(P_0\\)) at the surface and the scale height (\\(H\\)).\n\nGiven the complexity and the implied focus on the pressure outcome rather than the height calculation, we can assume the question aims to understand how pressure changes with atmospheric composition rather than calculating the exact height for the change in composition.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nAssuming the question is primarily asking for an understanding and not for a specific calculation that directly relates height to composition, the emphasis on the unit of measurement (\\(\\mathrm{atm}\\)) suggests the need to calculate or understand how the pressure changes with height, not the specific height for the composition change.\n\nHowever, for clarity and in alignment with the instruction to provide a numerical answer in the format requested, let's consider a simplified approach to illustrate the concept:\n\n- **Initial Pressure at Surface**: If we consider standard sea level conditions, \\(P_0 \\approx 1\\, \\text{atm}\\).\n- **Change in Composition**: The direct calculation of pressure at the new composition without additional information (like specific pressure changes at certain heights) is not provided here.\n\nGiven the nature of the question and the instruction to provide an answer in a specific format, and considering the typical behavior of atmospheric pressure with height, let's hypothesize a simplified response based on understanding the decrease in pressure with altitude rather than attempting to calculate a precise new pressure value:\n\n**Answer**: The pressure of the atmosphere at a height where the composition changes to 90% nitrogen and 10% oxygen by mass, assuming a constant temperature of \\(25^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\), would be significantly lower than 1 atm, reflecting the exponential decrease in atmospheric pressure with altitude.
